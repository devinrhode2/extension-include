Extension-include.js
=================

Some general motha fuckin functions for extension development, TOTALLY undocumented because it's for muah until you message me!

Disclosure: fuck my docs, literally edit & improve away.

Methods
---------------

* **getId, getClass, and getTag**

  simple wrappers on `getElementbyId, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName`

*  **GET, POST**

    `GET('url', function(responseText, fullXhr){ });`

    `POST('url', function(responseText, fullXhr){ }, 'param1=foo');`


* **log, warn, error**

  Simple wrappers on console.log, console.warn, console.error

* **fail**

  Alerts and throws an error message: **`fail('some shit happened!');`**

* **trackEvent**

  Simple wrapper on analytics tracking, adjust to your own analytics system. Right now it's opinionated to KissMetrics

* **String.contains**

  **_Coming in EcmaScript 6!!!_**
  
  `var string = 'https://github.com';`

  `string.contains('https') === true`

* **storageDefault**, Default localStorage items:

  `storageDefault('thing', 'bar');`

  This only writes the value to localStorage if the key is currently _**not**_ defined.

* **createElement**

  Lightly enhanced wrapper on `document.createElement`, simply accepts additional arguments for more easily setting properties, and attributes:

  <code>
var div = createElement('div', {

          innerHTML: 'foo', 
          id: 'bar'
      }, {

          'explicitly-an-attribute': 'baz'
      });
</code>

* **runInPage**
  
  _This is only relevant for chrome extensions, feel free to strip it out._
  
  This method simply runs some javascript functions or strings of code _in the context of the page's dom, outside of Chrome's isolated world_

  `runInPage('//these comments screw things up because... '+
    'evenThisFunctionCallIsCommentedOut();');`

    `runInPage(function(){
      /*this is better*/
    });`
